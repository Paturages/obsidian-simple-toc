# Obsidian Simple Table of Contents

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

Just a simple command to generate a table of contents in Markdown
with links from existing `#` headings. The way the links are generated
matches with how GitHub does it at least, I haven't tested this elsewhere.

Usage: `Ctrl+P` to open the command palette, `Simple Table of Contents`.
